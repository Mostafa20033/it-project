                      <p>
                      <strong>The history of the Alhambra</strong> is linked to the geographical location where it is located, Granada; On a rocky hill of difficult access, 
                       on the banks of the river Darro, protected by the mountains and surrounded by forest, among the oldest districts of the city, 
                       the Alhambra rises like an imposing castle of reddish tones in its walls that hide to the Exterior the delicate beauty of its interior.
                       Designed as a military zone at the beginning, the Alhambra became the royal 
                       residence and court of Granada in the mid-13th century after the establishment of the
                        Nasrid Kingdom and the construction of the first palace by the founding king Mohammed ibn Yusuf Ben Nasr, better known as <strong>Alhamar.</strong>

                       If you plan to visit the Catalan capital,<strong>The Familia</strong> should be at the
                       top of your list of things to see and do during your stay in Barcelona. This church will surprise you, not only because of its massive size,
                       but especially because of its avant-garde architecture, which perfectly shows off the genius of its architect, Antoni Gaudí.
                       This monumental basilica is known in Spanish as "el Templo Expiatorio de la Sagrada Familia", which literally translates to the "Expiatory Temple of the Sacred Family".
                       Although the official starting date of work on the basilica is March 19, 1882, construction truly began over a year later on August 25,1883.
                       Originally, it was architect Francisco de Paula del Villar who was in charge of the project.

                        <strong>The Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba</strong>  is a mosque turned cathedral in the city of Cordoba, Spain. It is dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary.
                        According to history, it has its origins dating back to the year 785 when it served as a mosque and was known as the Mezquita or Great Mosque of Córdoba, 
                        which was locally referred to as Mezquita de Córdoba. In modern times,
                        the Cordoba Mosque or the Mosque-Cathedral of Córdoba is also known as the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption, which happens to be its ecclesiastical name.
                        the structure was used as a mosque, but after the capture of Cordoba by the Christain forces in 1236,
                        it was converted into a cathedral with few alterations and architectural changes.
